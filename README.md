# Game Design Doc
## Summary
Mining game where you have to escort a minecart to the end of the mine with monsters trying to stop you. The minecart never stops. 

## Inspiration
1. Binding of isaac
    1. Combat and movement would work great with this game
    2. Rogue-Like
2. Deep rock galatic
    1. The concept of having a mining quota to aquire and to have to fight while mining.

## Story
You are lost in an abandoned mine shaft and you have to bring your quota of gold home.

## Gameplay
### Core Loop
Core gameplay loop of the game.

There would be mine cart that is always advancing, creating a sense of ergency. The player will have to stock the mine cart of gold 

### Mechanics
List all relevant mechanics and their use
- Cart moves forward at all time
- Gold must be mined and brought to the cart to meet the quota
- Monsters will try to destroy the cart
- Rails may be destroyed and must be repaired with steel.

### Movement/controls
#### Mobile(excluded for CS50 submition):
On screen joystick and another button for shooting/mining in the direction of movement. 

#### PC version:
Movement is inspired from binding of isaac, left stick(WASD) would control the player and A,B,X,Y(arrow keys) would control the attacking/mining.

### Levels
#### Level Design
The level will be a procedurally generated mineshaft that would be long enough for the level to last 1-2 minutes. Gold, steel and monster placement would be procedurally generated.
